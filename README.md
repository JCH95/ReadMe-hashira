# Professional README Generator

[How to create a Professional README](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide)

This project is a professional README.md generator. It was written using Javascript and Node.js. Once the command line is initiated,
the user is met with prompts asking details about the project. Once all the questions are answered, a README containing the answers
to all questions is generated in a DIST folder.
